        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Anna Paul and I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a biochemistry major with a pre-medicine emphasis. I do not have much job experience, however, I do have plenty of experience in volunteer work in my local community. I first began my volunteer work in my high school by participating in different events that the school was hosting or in an event it was supporting. I would stay after school and prepare for the events that were taking place in the school and stay if necessary to work in the background of the events. Some of these events included having a Christmas event for children in need and helping the children if they needed help in a particular section of the event. I had also volunteered in smaller events created by my school that was off-campus, such as visiting a retirement home and spending time with the elderly who donâ€™t typically get many visitors. <br><br>

        After gaining more experience I would slowly join volunteer events in my community and help more people in my city. I first began by joining a cleanup event hosted by my city. This would happen twice a year and I would always go out and clean different areas in the city or in a neighboring city. I ould be tired by the time these events were over but it had left me with a new perspective on how we can take care of our environment and the city and made me realize how much trash is littered everywhere. It gave me a lot of motivation to keep helping because thereâ€™s always a problem that people donâ€™t see but still need to fix. It led me to help more children in need by helping an organization I wasnâ€™t a part of but had wanted to support an annual event they did for the kids. I would join the organization and other people who have volunteered to meet at a nearby store before the sun rises and help the children pick out new clothing their family couldnâ€™t afford otherwise given money donated by the organization and community.<br><br>

        In my junior year of high school, the Hesperia Centennial Lions Club had been established and they were looking to form a Leos club consisting of teenagers who would help support their mission statement and give back to the community. My friends and I had joined and at first, only helped in forming the club and getting it on its feet before it began to grow. Once more members joined and we officially become recognized, we did programs that were centered on helping people with special needs. Through this club, I had joined the Rockâ€™n Our Disabilities Foundation as their mission was the same as the Lions club. Both clubs together hosted many different events in the city and even joined other clubs to join bigger events that ranged from both helping people in multiple cities or celebrating an occasion.
